## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

`Back in 2016, the company started imToken with a small group of people, when Ethereum was still in its early days. They wanted to offer people access to this new and exciting land of possibilities: sending tokens and owning crypto on their own devices.`


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

`In the very beginning imToken was only a wallet to send and receive ETH and ERC20 tokens. At that time, blockchain was still widely unknown in Asia. But that changed quickly in the following years. Now, 3 and a half years later, they are offering more features and access to more blockchains to their users.`
