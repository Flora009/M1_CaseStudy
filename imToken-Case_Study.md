## Business Activities

### Services/Functions Provided
Back in 2016, the company started imToken with a small group of people, when Ethereum was still in its early days. They wanted to offer people access to this new and exciting land of possibilities: sending tokens and owning crypto on their own devices.

In the very beginning imToken was only a wallet to send and receive ETH and ERC20 tokens. At that time, blockchain was still widely unknown in Asia. But that changed quickly in the following years. Now, 3 and a half years later, they are offering more features and access to more blockchains to their users.


imToken’s ecosystem of products include Tokenlon, an in-app decentralized exchange, and a decentralized app (DApp) store.
