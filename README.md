## Business Activities

### Services Provided

Back in 2016, the company started imToken with a small group of people, when Ethereum was still in its early days. They wanted to offer people access to this new and exciting land of possibilities: sending tokens and owning crypto on their own devices.

In the very beginning imToken was only a wallet to send and receive ETH and ERC20 tokens. At that time, blockchain was still widely unknown in Asia. But that changed quickly in the following years. Now, they are offering more features and access to more blockchains to their users.

imToken’s ecosystem of products include Tokenlon, an in-app decentralized exchange (DEX), and a decentralized app (DApp) store.


1. Multi-Chain Wallets Management
   * Manage your BTC, ETH, EOS, ATOM, BCH, TRX, LTC, CKB, DOT, KSM, FIL, XTZ tokens easily

2. In-app decentralized exchange (DEX): Tokenlon

    * DEX stands for decentralized exchange, it is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto traders. DEXs fulfill one of crypto’s core possibilities: fostering financial transactions that aren’t officiated by banks, brokers, or any other intermediary. 
    * The Tokenlon team was initially part of imToken wallet team, it is a decentralized crypto exchange platform like coinbase, binance, etc.

4. Staking
   * Staking is like a less resource-intensive alternative to mining. It involves holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the security and operations of a blockchain network. Simply put, staking is the act of locking cryptocurrencies to receive rewards. It's like depositing money in your bank account and receiving interest, though the technical mechanism is quite different.

5. Hardware Wallet: imKey
   * imKey is a mobile hardware wallet — mobile in the sense that it’s light and small (fitting into your leather wallet) and equipped with a secure bluetooth channel.

### Technologies
In order to design a secure, fast and user-friendly crypto wallet, the development team needs to be equipped with deep knowledge of modern web service development, including networking, cloud services (AWS or GCP), clustering technology (Kubernetes), containerization, databases, programming languages, and cryptography solutions etc.

### Challeges
1. Regulation
   * Regulation is always lagging. Every step early movers take forward will face risks and challenges because many areas are unknown for both regulators and early movers.
   * Regulations won’t become fewer, but rather more plenty. There will be some major steps taken by the US regulators to bring legal frameworks around blockchains and tokens.

2. Security
   * The banking system has had years to develop anti-fraud mechanisms that help detect a compromised credit card. If irregular spending patterns or locations are showing up on your statement, you would be flagged, whereas there are no such controls with your private key.

3. Technology evolution
   *  The development team must keep up with the fast growth and disruption of blockchain technologies, emerging crypto currencies and DApps.

4. Market Education
   * Blockchain products need to lower the barriers to attracting mass-market users, the layperson doesn’t have a strong understanding of how this software works, and may expect similar controls to the conventions they were used to before when utilizing a credit card. That’s why these problems must be solved in order for cryptocurrency solutions to scale to the masses.


### Major Competitors

## Vision
![vision](vision_and_roadmap-1.png)

imToken recently hosted an event in Singapore titled “**_Equal Access to the Tokenized World._**” It will focus on the realization of a Web 3.0 “Tokenized World”. 

>
>_“The wallet is known as ‘the home of Token’ and has played a critical role in assisting users in gaining access to the tokenized world. imToken aims to make the wallet an entryway to attract mass-market consumers._


## Recommendations

Since the technology evolution in Web 3.0 is growing fast, it is with no doubt that digital asset management facilities like crypto wallets will play a more and more important role in our future life.

As one of the first movers and dominators in crypto wallet domain, imToken, once said to be the biggest Ethereum crypto wallet in the world, hasn't secured its place among numbers of strong competitors. It originated from China where it gained a large number of seed users in the beginning, but at the moment, the government has banned crypto-related currencies, applications and platforms in China.

Key recommendations to imToken will include:
* Enhance network and storage security, fraud detection and  protections. Asset safety will always be the No.1 priority, especially in the tokenized world, one fraudulent transaction will cost the wallet owner lose all. Those who can protect clients' assets in a safe way will be much more likely to gain the market share. 
* Support for browser and make the APIs easier for other platforms/DApps to integrate with
* More branding and marketing campaigns, e.g. the current marketing campaigns conducted by imToken 'Learn to Earn' gives the users free NFT tokens if the users can pass the quiz and get 100/100 points. Marketing activities and campaigns like this will not only educate the users understand more about the features and functions, but also will increase the trust and loyalty of the customers.


### Summary

A more recent survey revealed that there are now 68.42 million blockchain wallet users. Crypto Market Sizing The cryptocurrency market size is expected to grow from USD 1.6 billion in 2021 to USD 2.2 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 7.1%. 

Since 2016, imToken has served **14M+** users, with over **$500B** cryptocurrencies exchanged in over 150 countries & regions around the world. 

In the next ten to twenty years, blockchain will revolutionize the financial industry on a global scale. We believe that imToken is riding this trend, and has strongly positioned itself in the market.
